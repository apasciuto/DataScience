### Overview

This week we learned how to craft appropriate problem statements, work with pivot tables, and started learning about Pandas. Additionally, we learned how to clean data and use dummy variables. Now,  we're going to apply some of these newly acquired skills in our second project. Given a dirty dataset, you will do some exploratory data analysis. You will create a Jupyter writeup hosted on GitHub that provides a dataset overview with visualizations, statistical analysis, and data cleaning methodologies.

As an aside, you should get used to hearing this statistic: 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data, also known as EDA (Dasu and Johnson 2003). When you're looking at raw data, preparing for an interview or starting a new project, keep that in mind. Good models cannot produce good predictions without _good data_.

#### Project Summary

On next week's episode of the 'Are You Entertained?' podcast, we're going to be analyzing the latest generation's guilty pleasure- the music of the '00s. Our Data Scientists have poured through Billboard chart data to analyze what made a hit soar to the top of the charts, and how long they stayed there. Tune in next week for an awesome exploration of music and data as we continue to address an omnipresent question in the industry- _why do we like what we like?_

For this project, we'll be posting a companion writeup with visualizations that will offer insights into our conclusions.

**Goal**: Jupyter technical notebook including plotting and statistical analysis, with process and results translated.

### Dataset

- [Dataset: Billboard Hits](./assets/billboard.csv)

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Read in your dataset
- Try out a few NumPy commands to describe your data
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.  
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success!
- Document **everything**.
