- Walkthrough the data science workflow using a case study in the Pandas library
- Import, format and clean data using the Pandas Library
### Statistics Fundamental I
- Use NumPy and Pandas libraries to analyze datasets using basic summary statistics: mean, median, mode, max, min, quartile, inter-quartile, range, variance, standard deviation and correlation
- Create data visualization – scatter plots, scatter matrix, line graph, box blots, and histograms – to discern characteristics and trends in a dataset
- Identify a normal distribution within a dataset using summary statistics and visualization
### Statistics Fundamental II
- Explain the difference between causation vs. correlation
- Test a hypothesis within a sample case study
- Validate your findings using statistical analysis (p-values, confidence intervals)

## Unit 2: Foundations of Data Modeling
### Introduction to Regression
- Define data modeling and linear regression
- Differentiate between categorical and continuous variables
- Build a linear regression model using a dataset that meets the linearity assumption using the scikit-learn library
### Evaluating Model Fit
- Define regularization, bias, and errors metrics;
- Evaluate model fit by using loss functions including mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error
- Select regression methods based on fit and complexity
### Introduction to Classification
- Define a classification model
- Build a K–Nearest Neighbors using the scikit–learn library
- Evaluate and tune model by using metrics such as classification accuracy ⁄ error
### Introduction to Logistic Regression
- Build a Logistic regression classification model using the scikit learn library
- Describe the sigmoid function, odds, and odds ratios and how they relate to logistic regression
- Evaluate a model using metrics such as classification accuracy ⁄ error, confusion matrix, ROC ⁄ AOC curves, and loss functions
### Communicate Results from Logistic Regression
- Explain the tradeoff between the precision and recall of a model and articulate the cost of false positives vs. false negatives.
- Identify the components of a concise, convincing report and how they relate to specific audiences ⁄ stakeholders
- Describe the difference between visualization for presentations vs. exploratory data analysis
